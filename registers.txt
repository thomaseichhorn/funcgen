#### additional information


### "wave" mode:

** Register 20: channel-enable: 2-value field
(channel1 , channel 2)

** Register 21 and 22: waveform
0 = sine
1 = square
2 = pulse
3 = triangle
4 = partial Sine
5 = CMOS
6 = DC
7 = Half Wave
8 = Full Wave
9 = Pos. Lader
10 = Neg. Lader
11 = Noise
12 = Exp. Rise
13 = Exp. Decay
14 = Multi Tone
15 = Sinc
16 = Lorenz
101 to 160 = Arbitrary01 to Arbitrary60


** Register 23 and 24: frequency
Format: frequency,multiplier

Frequency: unit = Hz / 100
Multiplier:
0:	1 (Hz)
1: 1e3 (Khz)
2: 1e6 (MHz)
3: 1e-3 (mHz)
4: 1e-6 (µHz)

For multipliers 0 (Hz), 1 (KHz) and 2 (MHz), the multiplier setting only
changes the visualisation aspect of the frequency on the UI
For multipliers 2 (mHZ) and 3 (µ Hz), the multiplier affects both the
visualisation and the frequency!
Using multipliers 2 and 3 allows for setting the frequency with a precision 
larger then 0.01 Hz.

The maximum frequencies are:
multipliers 0, 1 and 2: hardware limit of signal generator
multiplier 2: 80 KHz
multiplier 3: 80 Hz


** Register 25 and 26: amplitude
unit = mV

** Register 27 and 28: DC offset
unit = 0.01V, then add 1000 

** Register 29 and 30: DutyCycle
unit = 0.1 degrees
